Medication Interaction Checker  Problem: Build a system that analyzes patient medication lists and identifies potential dangerous interactions.
----------------------->
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that leverages Hugging Face's language models to analyze medication lists and identify potential drug-drug interactions and side effects. Users can input multiple medications, and the app intelligently generates warnings based on known interactions. Built using Python, it showcases the integration of AI/LLMs in healthcare and provides a simple yet powerful tool for promoting safe medication usage.
